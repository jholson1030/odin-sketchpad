# odin-sketchpad
Sketchpad made with Javascript


Project Objectives:
    - Create a grid of cells (<divs>) that is 16 x 16 only using Javascript DOM [x]
    - Change the color of each cell on mouseover [x]
    - An eraser option to change individual cells back to white [x]
    - Add a clear button to clear the grid back to it's default setting [x]
    - Add a HTML color picker and implement it in Javascript [x]
    - An option to change the size of the grid while keeping the container (canvas) the same size. (Since I am shooting for a pixel art 
    sketchpad look I will have options for 8 x 8, 16 x 16, 32 x 32, and 64 x 64) [x]
    *** UPDATE: I used a slider to set the number of cells in the grid for more customization and detail. ***
    - An optional feature to use a brush that will change the cells a random color, i.e. a rainbow brush [x]

Things I want to add to make this more fleshed out pixel art sketchpad:
    - An option to export an image as a downloadable PNG file
    - Change the event listener for the brushes to react on mouse click (and drag) rather then just mouseover for more detailed work [x]
    - An option to change the canvas color [x]
    *** UPDATE: Instead of changing the canvas color I will add a fill option that will fill an area with the desired color. ***
    - Day/night mode [x]
    - Style the webpage to have an 'old school MS Paint' feel to it.
